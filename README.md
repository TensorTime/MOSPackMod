I wrote this mod to help fill in some gaps in integration for mods in 1.11.2 and some which had minor unpatched bugs which aren't getting fixed.  Your mileage may vary if you use it any other pack and I'm not providing support for it outside of the My Own Sink modpack.

 

Current functionality.

 

Provides a temporary replacement to FTB Tweaks by adding the same functionality.  Do not install tweaks along side this.  As soon as tweaks is working in 1.11.2 I'll be yanking this code.  FTB Tweaks is also MIT Licensed as is this mod. 

 

Integrates Embers Caminite with The Tinker's Construct Drying Rack.  So pretty much any of the raw items will dry to their appropriate brick or stamp.

 

Future plans:

 

Any other IMC integration needed for the My Own Sink pack modpack.
